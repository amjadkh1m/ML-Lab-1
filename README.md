Hi, I’m Amjad Khalid.
I’m a third-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in Machine Learning and its applications in solving real-world problems and improving daily life. I enjoy exploring the latest technologies and applying them to practical projects. I also like tackling programming challenges and learning new tools that help me develop my skills further.
I’m looking forward to making the most out of this course, discovering new ideas, and collaborating with my peers to achieve meaningful and exciting goals.
